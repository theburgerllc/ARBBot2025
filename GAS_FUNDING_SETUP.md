## 🚀 **Quick Setup (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Contract**
```bash
# Deploy contract with gas funding capabilities
npm run deploy:arb
```

### **Step 2: Configure Gas Funding**
```bash
# Set up 10% profit allocation to gas wallet
npm run gas-funding:setup
```

### **Step 3: Start Monitoring**
```bash
# Start continuous gas funding monitor
npm run gas-funding:monitor
```

### **Step 4: Start Bot**
```bash

## 🔧 **Detailed Configuration**

### **Initial Setup Commands**

```bash
# 1. Set gas funding wallet address (already configured)
npm run gas-funding:setup

# 2. Check current status
npm run gas-funding:status

# 3. Adjust funding percentage (optional)
npm run gas-funding:adjust 15  # Set to 15%

## 💰 **How It Works**

### **Profit Flow**
```
Flash Loan Arbitrage Trade
├── Profit: 0.01 ETH
├── 10% (0.001 ETH) → Gas Wallet (0x0696...)
└── 90% (0.009 ETH) → Contract (for owner withdrawal)
```

### **Gas Funding Process**
1. **Trade Execution**: Bot executes profitable arbitrage
2. **Profit Calculation**: Contract calculates net profit
3. **Automatic Split**: 10% goes to gas wallet, 90% to contract
4. **Gas Coverage**: Gas wallet funds future transactions
5. **Owner Profits**: Remaining 90% available for withdrawal

### **Self-Sustaining Cycle**
- **Daily Profit**: 1 ETH → 0.1 ETH gas funding + 0.9 ETH owner profit
- **Gas Coverage**: 0.1 ETH funds ~1000 transactions (at 0.0001 ETH each)
- **Sustainability**: System runs indefinitely without manual funding

---

## 📊 **Performance Projections**

### **Conservative Scenario (1 ETH/day profit)**
- **Gas Funding**: 0.1 ETH/day (10%)
- **Owner Profit**: 0.9 ETH/day (90%)
- **Transactions Funded**: ~1000/day
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Immediate

### **Aggressive Scenario (10 ETH/day profit)**
- **Gas Funding**: 1.0 ETH/day (10%)
- **Owner Profit**: 9.0 ETH/day (90%)
- **Transactions Funded**: ~10,000/day
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Immediate + reserve building

### **Break-even Analysis**
| Transactions/Day | Required Daily Profit | Avg Profit/Trade |
|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 50 trades        | 0.05 ETH            | 0.001 ETH        |
| 100 trades       | 0.1 ETH             | 0.001 ETH        |
| 500 trades       | 0.5 ETH             | 0.001 ETH        |

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **Gas Funding Percentages**
```bash
# Conservative (5% funding)
npm run gas-funding:adjust 5

# Recommended (10% funding) 
npm run gas-funding:adjust 10

# Aggressive (15% funding)
npm run gas-funding:adjust 15

# Maximum allowed (50% funding)
npm run gas-funding:adjust 50
```

### **Withdrawal Thresholds**
Current automatic withdrawal thresholds:
- **WETH**: 0.01 ETH
- **USDC**: 10 USDC
- **USDT**: 10 USDT

- **Balance Validation**: Ensures sufficient contract balance before transfers

### **Emergency Commands**
```bash
# Disable gas funding immediately
npm run gas-funding:disable

# Emergency withdraw all profits
npm run withdraw-profits:emergency

# Check system status
npm run gas-funding:status
```

### **Monitoring & Alerts**
- **Real-time balance tracking**
- **Automatic threshold alerts**
- **Performance statistics**
- **Gas consumption analysis**
